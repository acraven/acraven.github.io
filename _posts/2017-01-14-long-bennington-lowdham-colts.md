It was touch and go whether the pitch would thaw out in time for the mid-morning kick-off; the frost disappeared from the grass but the ground remained firm throughout. It looked like our boys needed to thaw out too, the visitors having the first chance in an even first 10-15 minutes.

Lowdham Colts were languishing at the bottom of the league, and the defeat will not have improved their situation. How they are down there is anyone’s guess; they only lost 1-0 to Wollaton Hall and Bramcote before Christmas who themselves have only dropped 5 points so far. It’s no surprise therefore, that we struggled to make easy work of our victory.

Both sides felt aggrieved by some of the referee’s decisions, we should have been awarded two free-kicks early on as we were hacked over on the hard ground. The opposition thought our first goal had more than a whiff of [Ollie Barry’s] hand-ball about it; a “sensational” [Steve’s word] Toby put a ball through for Opposition Man of the Match Jamie to run on too, who whipped in a cross for Man of the Match Ollie Barry to bury from 6 yards out.

The inclusion of Sam Green, Will and Toby after 12 minutes completed the thaw with Josh barking out encouragement. Will introduced himself to his man within moments with a tactical shove in the back, Sam Green did to the right-back what Jamie was doing to the left-back and Toby made pass after clinical pass. It took 4 minutes for Ollie Barry to give us the lead.

We didn’t manage to test the ‘keeper in the remainder of the half, but we had 3 or 4 good shots that were just wide of the mark. Despite dominating, we couldn’t get daylight between us and a team that “has a goal in them” [Steve’s words]; the half finished a tight 1-0.

Much like he predicted our victory over Nottingham FC, Steve wasn’t wrong; the visitors started much the brighter side in the second and equalised within a minute of the restart. Top corner from 30 yards, Charlie had no chance.

We recovered our composure and started to apply some pressure; Sam Wright invited the ‘keeper to make a spectacular save with a finger-tip with a looping shot to the back post and he obliged. This was the catalyst for a series of shots leading up to Jamie running the entire right wing and crossing for Sam Green to smash in from 6 yards to restore our goal advantage midway through the half. 2-1.

Charlie made a fine reaction save minutes later to prevent the equaliser. He backed that up with another as Lowdham piled on the pressure, winning corner after corner. They began to over commit allowing Sam Wright to force their ‘keeper into saving. Ollie Barry then smashed our 3rd in to give us what should have been a comfortable last few seconds to hold on. The referee found 4 minutes from somewhere, which did give Bradley (who had a great game) chance to test the ‘keeper one last time, but crucially also allowed the visitors to score and set up a nail biting last couple of minutes. We held on though, for a deserved win.

With Toton losing to Radcliffe, Farndon losing to Attenborough and Wollaton Hall and Bramcote not playing, we jump from 7th to 4th, to within 5 points of 2nd place Bottesford.

We have arguably our biggest game of the season on Saturday. Said 2nd place Bottesford are heading over, no doubt with the intention to right a wrong (at least in their eyes). If I remember correctly, we beat them before Christmas, something like 4-1, so they will be very hungry. It would be a tremendous achievement if we can do “the double” and take ourselves to within 2 points of them.

If we can ask one thing all season: please, please, please, no girlfriends, no sleep-overs, no alcohol, no cigarettes, no drugs (soft or hard) on Friday night; just plenty of sleep and a good early breakfast on Saturday morning. Steve won’t approve, but if they get cold hands, send them in a pair of thin gloves. We are talking marginal gains. Kick-off is 10:30, please report with match winning attitude at 9:45.

Thanks to Pete and Will for running the line.
