Let’s just say that again, Bottesford 1 Long Bennington 4. Sounds good, doesn’t it? Really good. Bottesford 1 Long Bennington 4! Bragging rights were well earned for the Belvoir High [and Harrowby] boys by the whole team who thoroughly deserved to walk off as winners to a round of applause having come from behind. Unfortunately, Leicestershire have broken up for Christmas, so said rights will have to be exercised in the New Year.

Bottesford were 3 points behind Attenborough Colts with a game in hand going in the game. They have not lost all season, and they had a 100% home record until today. Make no mistake, they are a good side and are second in the league on merit; the league table doesn’t lie by this time of year.

The boys all put in match winning performances today, Man of the Match Tom King neutralised Bottesford’s biggest threat, Louis Butler mopped up as last man, Charlie was quick off his line, Ollie Howgill and Will Herring prevented the wide players getting around the back or coming inside, Owen and Bradley dominated the midfield, Toby and Louis Boyle made sublime passes, Ollie Barry’s touches and flicks were first class, Sam Green pressed and hassled the defence, Sam Wright got deep and fed an advancing midfield and Jamie Staunton got behind and supplied cross after cross. The game plan was executed perfectly, Bottesford couldn’t play their own football, and if my notes are to be trusted, could only manage 1 shot (off-target) in the 2nd half. One of their parents said they were like a flat bottle of Coke; if that was the case our boys had taken the fizz out of their game.

We started brightly following Toby’s team talk, getting the ball to Jamie who moved it quickly down the right wing. It was Toby who forced a save early on, shortly followed by Sam Wright who hit the underside of the cross-bar.

Conceding a soft goal in the 12th minute was not part of the plan, but parity was restored minutes later as a quick throw in by Ollie Howgill to Sam Wright who found Jamie for a smart finish. Sam Green and Owen both had shots on target, but the half finished 1-1.

The second half started just as brightly, Jamie testing the ‘keeper early on before being involved in the 2nd goal, Louis Boyle to Jamie to Ollie Barry for Sam Wright to squeeze under the ‘keeper into the net. 1-2.

Bradley managed a couple of shots on target, but the real drama happened in 3 minutes in the middle of the half. Jamie’s shot game off the ‘keeper for Sam Wright to finish off; the flag was raised but after a discussion the linesman was overruled. 1-3. Shortly after the restart, a clearance was then blocked, which Jamie pounced on for our 4th. Our finishing today was clinical.

We remain in 7th place, but we’ve reduced the gap between us and 2nd place, and with a few other good results against the top half we could be pressing for a top three finish. We have a trip to Holy Spirit Celtic on 7th January before hosting Lowdham Colts and Bottesford on the 14th and 21st respectively. We should be targeting wins against Holy Spirit Celtic and Lowdham Colts, and if we repeat today’s performance there’s no reason we shouldn’t beat Bottesford too.

Thanks to Will and Des for running the line.
