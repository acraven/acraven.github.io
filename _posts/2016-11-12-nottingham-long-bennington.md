What an absolute belter of a football match, you couldn’t write all the twists and turns in fate. Not too many people (other than Steve) would have said we stood a chance today, against a side 2 divisions above us, but those that did weren’t wrong. The learnings from today are very much, if you play as a team, with great spirit, commitment and belief, it is possible beat anyone on the day.

The home side will no doubt regret underestimating us, they were late out and didn’t appear to warm up in any shape or form before kick-off. It looked as if their warm-up took place in the first 10 minutes of the game, we were on top from the whistle playing for the most part in the opposition’s half with Sam Green and Jamie making dangerous runs.

We had the best chance early on and it’s fair to say that the 2-goal deficit after 15 minutes was completely undeserved following 2 quick soft goals. Nottingham might have thought job done at this point, they were the weaker side, 2-0 up and had forced Charlie into a double save moments later.

We ended the half with the feeling that we could have been in the lead with a little luck; we made several chances, putting 2 just wide as well as hitting the post and forcing the ‘keeper into a save.

The BBC will no doubt regretting leaving this game off the schedules as what followed was one of the most memorable victories in the history of our team.

The second half was non-stop end-to-end action: James Scott tested the ‘keeper following the stubborn persistence of Ollie Barry. Charlie saved. Louis Boyle headed wide. Charlie saved. Toby scored, poking home a ball that fell to his feet at the 6-yard line. Charlie saved. Toby shot on target. Charlie saved. Sam Wright converted penalty, a smart low finish after being bundled over bursting into the box. A crazy twenty-two minutes that restored parity. 2-2.

It didn’t stop there, we dominated the next spell and in the 74th minute we were 3-2 up. We had put a couple wide and Sam Wright had worked the ‘keeper before Jamie broke onto a superb ball from Man of the Match Owen driving it low through the ‘keeper into the back of the net. An excellent and most deserved turnaround – could we hold on for the final 6 minutes?

We had given ourselves a great chance to win it in normal time, but the home side levelled it with 2 minutes to go. Owen managed a shot on target, but the ‘keeper was equal to it and the whistle blew for full-time.

Extra-time was a comparative anti-climax given the end of the second half, but it was still entertaining end-to-end stuff. Inevitably though, the game ended 3-3 after extra-time and penalties would be needed to separate the teams. Credit to Tom, Sam Wright, Sam Green, Bradley and Ollie Howgill who stepped up to take the first 5 penalties, and to those who didn’t want to take them, but took them well.

Both teams had a chance each to score and win the tie, but the heroics came from our very own Cheds who got both hands to a well taken penalty in the top-right corner. It seemed to take an age to come down, but it came down wide and the celebrations began.

Sadly, our victory came at a cost; James Scott fractured his ankle in a crunching tackle towards the end of extra-time. We wish him all the best for a speedy recovery.

Our victory gives us an away tie with Calverton Miners’ Welfare on 10th December. Not that it matters, but they sit immediately below Nottingham in Division 1 and by some twist they haven’t played a game in the cup yet. Let’s hope this is their one and only.

We have a few league matches before then, the first of which is away to Radcliffe Olympic. On paper this looks like it should be 3 points for us, we beat them 7-1 early this season and their only points come from victories against the two bottom sides. However, as Nottingham have learned, we must not be complacent. Kick-off is 10:30am, please report by 9:45am.

Thanks to Des and Richard for running the line today; like the referee, no overtime payments for the extra 20 minutes I’m afraid.
